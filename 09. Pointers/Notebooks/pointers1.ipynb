    "In C++, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. \n",
    "Pointers are used for dynamic memory allocation, efficient array handling, and for passing large structures or objects to functions to avoid copying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "int a = 10;\n",
    "int* p = &a; // 'p' is a pointer to 'a'\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses of pointers:\n",
    "- Dynamic memory management (using new and delete)\n",
    "- Efficient array and string manipulation\n",
    "- Implementing data structures like linked lists, trees, etc.\n",
    "- Function arguments for modifying actual values (pass by reference)\n"
