    "# C++ Pointer Doubts Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ DOUBT 01: Why pointer size was coming 8 while printing\n",
    "\n",
    "In C++, the size of a pointer is architecture-dependent and can vary depending on the target platform. However, on most modern platforms, including those based on x86-64 architecture (the most common for desktops and servers), pointers are typically **8 bytes (64 bits)** in size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**  \n",
    "- Each byte of memory has a unique address.\n",
    "- A pointer stores the address of another variable.\n",
    "- The size of a pointer variable is determined by the size of memory addresses used by the architecture.\n",
    "- x86-64 supports up to 2<sup>64</sup> bytes of addressable memory, requiring 64-bit (8-byte) addresses.\n",
    "- Thus, pointers on x86-64 are 8 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other factors:**  \n",
    "- Compilers may add padding/alignment.\n",
    "- Some platforms may have different pointer sizes for different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "Pointer size in C++ depends on architecture, compiler, and memory organization. On x86-64, it's typically 8 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ DOUBT 02: Why we cannot do `arr = arr + 1;` in C++\n",
    "\n",
    "In C++, the name of an array is a **constant pointer** to its first element.  \n",
    "- You **cannot modify** the value of the array pointer itself using pointer arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n",
    "arr = arr + 1; // ❌ Compilation error\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But you can use pointer arithmetic with a separate pointer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "int *ptr = arr; // pointer to first element\n",
    "ptr++;          // now points to second element\n",
    "cout << *ptr << endl; // prints 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "You can't change the array's base address, but you can use pointer arithmetic with other pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ DOUBT 03: Wild pointer in C++\n",
    "\n",
    "A **wild pointer** is a pointer that is uninitialized or has been deleted. Accessing or dereferencing a wild pointer leads to undefined behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common scenarios:**\n",
    "1. **Uninitialized pointers**\n",
    "    ```cpp\n",
    "    int *ptr;\n",
    "    cout << *ptr << endl; // undefined behavior\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. **Deleted pointers**\n",
    "    ```cpp\n",
    "    int *ptr = new int;\n",
    "    delete ptr;\n",
    "    cout << *ptr << endl; // undefined behavior\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. **Pointers to non-existent variables**\n",
    "    ```cpp\n",
    "    int *ptr = &x; // if x is not declared/initialized\n",
    "    cout << *ptr << endl; // undefined behavior\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to avoid:**\n",
    "- Always initialize pointers.\n",
    "- Set pointers to `nullptr` after deleting.\n",
    "- Check pointer validity before dereferencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ DOUBT 04: Void pointer in C++\n",
    "\n",
    "A **void pointer** (`void*`) can point to any data type, but cannot be dereferenced directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "void* ptr;\n",
    "int x = 10;\n",
    "ptr = &x;\n",
    "int* intPtr = static_cast<int*>(ptr);\n",
    "cout << *intPtr << endl; // prints 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic memory allocation:**\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "int* ptr = new int;\n",
    "void* voidPtr = ptr;\n",
    "int* intPtr = static_cast<int*>(voidPtr);\n",
    "*intPtr = 10;\n",
    "cout << *ptr << endl; // prints 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**About `static_cast<int*>`:**  \n",
    "`static_cast` is a compile-time cast.  \n",
    "- `static_cast<int*>(voidPtr)` tells the compiler to treat `voidPtr` as an `int*`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "Void pointers are generic pointers. Cast them to the correct type before use.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ DOUBT 05: Dangling pointer in C++\n",
    "\n",
    "A **dangling pointer** points to memory that has been freed or deallocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "int* p = new int;\n",
    "*p = 42;\n",
    "delete p;\n",
    "cout << *p << endl; // undefined behavior\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do they arise?**\n",
    "- Freeing memory while a pointer still points to it.\n",
    "- Returning a pointer to a local variable.\n",
    "- Using a pointer after it has been deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to avoid:**\n",
    "- Use smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, `weak_ptr`).\n",
    "- Use references instead of pointers where possible.\n",
    "- Nullify pointers after deleting/freeing memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ DOUBT 06: Pointers important doubt\n",
    "\n",
    "**Array of pointers:**  \n",
    "An array where each element is a pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "int* arr[3]; // array of 3 int pointers\n",
    "int nums[3] = {1, 2, 3};\n",
    "arr[0] = &nums[0];\n",
    "arr[1] = &nums[1];\n",
    "arr[2] = &nums[2];\n",
    "cout << *arr[0] << endl; // 1\n",
    "cout << *arr[1] << endl; // 2\n",
    "cout << *arr[2] << endl; // 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pointer to an array:**  \n",
    "A pointer that points to the first element of an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "int* ptr = nums; // pointer to int\n",
    "cout << *ptr << endl;      // 1\n",
    "cout << *(ptr + 1) << endl; // 2\n",
    "cout << *(ptr + 2) << endl; // 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pointer to an array of 10 integers:**\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "int nums[10] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};\n",
    "int (*ptr)[10] = &nums;\n",
    "cout << (*ptr)[0] << endl; // 1\n",
    "cout << (*ptr)[1] << endl; // 2\n",
    "cout << (*ptr)[2] << endl; // 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "- Array of pointers: each element is a pointer.\n",
    "- Pointer to array: points to the whole array.\n",
    "- `int (*ptr)[10]` is a pointer to an array of 10 integers.\n",
